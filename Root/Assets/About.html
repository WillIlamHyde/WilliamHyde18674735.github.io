<h1> Supreme Origin</h1>

<p>In April 1994, Supreme opened its doors on Lafayette Street in 
downtown Manhatten and became the home of New York City skate
culture. At its core was the gang of rebellious young New York
skaters and artists who became the store's staff, crew and customers.</p>

<p>Supreme grew to be the embodiment of the downtown culture,
playing an integral part in its constant regeneration. Skaters, 
punks, hip-hop heads - the young counter culture at large - all 
gravitated towards Supreme.</p>

<p>While it grew into a downtown institution, Supreme established 
itself as a brand known for its quality, style and authenticity.</p>

<p>Over its eighteen year history, Supreme has worked with some of 
our generation's most groundbreaking designers, artists, photographers 
and musicians - all who have helped continue to define its unique identity
and attitude.</p>
