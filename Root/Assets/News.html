<h1> Supreme/Marvin Gaye </h1>
<p> Marvin Gay Jr. was born in 1939 and raised in Southwest Washington
, D.C. After relocating to Detroit and signing with Motown subsidiary 
Tamla Records in 1960, Gaye’s career as a soul singer, songwriter, 
session musician and producer crystalized over the decade, culminating
 with his first Billboard #1 — “I Heard it Through the Grapevine” — in 
 1968. Yet, Gaye felt dissatisfied with his success, and bucked Motown 
 pop convention to craft his 11th studio album, What’s Going On.</p>

<p>The nine-track concept record, released in 1971, follows a soldier
 returning home from the Vietnam War to find poverty, abuse and injustice.
 Today, What’s Going On is considered one of the most important albums of
 all time. Its sociopolitical lyricism and fusion of jazz, gospel and orchestral
 elements made a transformative impact on popular music. Gaye was fatally shot 
 by his father in 1984; he was 44 years old.</p>

<p>This fall, Supreme will release a collection featuring original album artwork
 from What’s Going On. The collection consists of a Hooded Sweatshirt, T-Shirt 
 and Skateboard. The Marvin Gaye group will be available along with four new Winter T-Shirts.</p>

<p>Available in-store NY, Brooklyn, LA, London, Paris and online December 13th.</p>

<p>Available in Japan on December 15th.</p>
